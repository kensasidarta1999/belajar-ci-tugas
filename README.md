## got the problem with the style?

That's because Git converts files in _public/NiceAdmin_ to LF while the file format on your computer is CRF. To solve this, replace NiceAdmin in _public/NiceAdmin_ with the new one, you can download it from [here](https://psi.dinus.ac.id/april/assets/NiceAdmin.zip).

### Thank You
